This Rails app follows this article [How to Test Rails Models with RSpec](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/how-to-test-rails-models-with-rspec#h-what-is-behaviour-driven-development) which should cover the followings:

1. TDD?

   - Test Driven Development
   - Test-First Programming
   - allows **short feedback loops** where developers write just the right amount of code and design to make the software work
