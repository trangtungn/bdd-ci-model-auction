This Rails app follows this article [How to Test Rails Models with RSpec](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/how-to-test-rails-models-with-rspec#h-what-is-behaviour-driven-development) which should cover the followings:
   1. Using RSpec to test models and business logic.
   2. Applying Continuous Integration with  Semaphore to automate testing

## Questions? Problems?
1. TDD?

   - [Test Driven Development](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/test-driven-development)
   - Test-First Programming
   - allows **short feedback loops** where developers write just the right amount of code and design to make the software work

   - [Mocking technique](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/mocking-with-rspec-doubles-and-expectations)

2. BDD?

   - [Behavior-Driven Development](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/behavior-driven-development)
   - is a software development process which is about minimizing feedback loop
   - combines general techniques and principles of **Test Driven Development** (TDD)
   - what, not how: We think about what the system does, rather than how it does it.
   - is not UI testing.

3. Testing models (Bid, Auction, User)

4. Testing business logic (BiddingEngine)

5. Using CI to automate testing
